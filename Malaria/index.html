  <h1>Malaria</h1>

<h2 id="definition">DEFINITION<a class="headerlink" href="#definition" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Malaria is caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, all of which are transmitted by bites of infected anopheline mosquitoes.1,2 Malaria is typically characterized by an acute febrile illness, with parasites infecting large numbers of erythrocytes, and classically entails recurrent episodes of fever and chills. It was first described thousands of years ago and is named on the basis of the belief that it was caused by the bad air of the marshes surrounding Rome. Malaria is common, causing hundreds of millions of illnesses each year throughout most of the tropics. Severe disease can occur, primarily with Plasmodium falciparum infection, with the acute development of serious organ dysfunction or when chronic and repeated infection leads to severe anemia. P. falciparum malaria has killed about half a million people per year in recent years, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Pathogen P. falciparum is responsible for most episodes of severe malaria. It is endemic in most malarious areas and is by far the predominant species in Africa. Plasmodium vivax is about as common as P. falciparum, except in Africa, but causes severe disease much less commonly. However, studies suggest that severe illness associated with P. vivax infection is more common than had previously been appreciated.3 Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae are much less common causes of disease and generally do not cause severe illness. A fifth parasite causing human infections is Plasmodium knowlesi, a parasite of macaque monkeys that is a fairly common zoonosis in parts of Southeast Asia and has been responsible for malarial illnesses, including severe disease, in individuals exposed to macaque-biting vectors in forested areas. EPIDEMIOLOGY Malaria in Endemic Countries Malaria is the most important parasitic disease of humans, causing hundreds of millions of illnesses and hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. The disease is endemic in most of the tropics, including many parts of South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Transmission, morbidity, and mortality are greatest in Africa, where infection with P. falciparum predominates. In most other endemic areas, disease caused by both P. falciparum and P. vivax is common. In highly endemic areas, the group at greatest risk is young children, who experience most episodes of disease and the most deaths. A second high-risk group is pregnant women, with high risks of maternal and fetal morbidity from P. falciparum malaria, including many deaths secondary to low birthweight. In highly endemic areas, in addition to extensive mortality, malaria exerts a massive toll through adverse effects on child development; contributions to school and work absenteeism; and, overall, billions of dollars in lost income among the poorest citizens of the poorest countries of the world. In areas of developing countries with lower levels of malaria transmission, malaria can be epidemic, with intermittent increases in transmission that cause major morbidity in relatively nonimmune populations. Although the burden of malaria remains enormous, with increased control activities worldwide mortality was estimated to decrease 57% between 2000 and 2015, with 446,0004 or 631,0005 deaths in 2015 reported using different modeling approaches. However, after marked gains, morbidity and mortality appear to have stabilized, with World Health Organization (WHO) estimates essentially unchanged since 2015. Malaria in Travelers Malaria is also common in travelers of any age from nonendemic areas to the tropics and may be manifested in those who have returned to nonendemic areas up to many months after travel. Indeed, malaria is the most common documented cause of febrile illness in travelers returning from the tropics to developed countries. Malaria is also rarely transmitted in areas considered nonendemic, including the United States, when imported parasites are transmitted by local anopheline mosquitoes, by blood products, or through congenital spread of infection. Malaria Transmission Malaria is transmitted by multiple species of mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles, which vary in geographic distribution, ecologic preferences, and susceptibility to mosquito control measures. Anopheline mosquitoes bite at night, so personal mosquito control measures focus on avoidance of mosquito bites during sleep. Levels of malaria transmission in endemic areas vary greatly, from areas where residents experience only rare infectious bites to regions of Africa where individuals may receive hundreds of infectious bites each year. Recent Changes in the Epidemiology of Malaria A major effort to eradicate malaria after World War II led to elimination of the disease in many areas, including the United States and Europe, but eventually failed to control the disease in most of the tropics. During the ensuing decades, improvements in malaria control were few, and malarial morbidity worsened in many areas, driven by the loss of enthusiasm for vector control; increasing resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides; and, in particular, resistance of parasites to commonly used antimalarial drugs. More than 50 years later, a new large effort to control and eventually to eradicate malaria has been initiated.6 Key control measures include indoor residual spraying of insecticides, distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, prompt provision of effective drugs to those with malaria, and targeted administration of drugs to prevent infection in high-risk groups. Recent efforts have led to documented decreases in levels of malarial morbidity and mortality in some areas, notably parts of Africa, Asia, and Oceania with relatively low levels of transmission intensity. It is of great interest to learn whether recent advances due to intensified control efforts can bring sustained improvements to those parts of the world most affected with malaria, in particular, highly endemic regions of Africa and Asia. Malaria and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection Malaria does not differ as markedly between those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and others as is the case with typical opportunistic infections. However, several interactions between malaria and HIV infection have been established. First, HIV infection appears to disrupt the acquired immune response to malaria and thereby increases the incidence and severity of malaria. Second, acute malaria elevates HIV viral load and so</p>
